			<p>FOX, NBC, CBS, and ABC each release quantitative viewership data of the Super Bowl each year they broadcast the game. The Super Bowl started in 1967 and the data goes until 2022’s game. There has been a dramatic increase in the streaming of the game, while TV viewership was kept afloat by the coronavirus pandemic. Now the coronavirus pandemic is over, networks are beginning to transition to put more of their assets into their streaming platforms, becoming more subscriber-based. This can be seen through networks (like NBC with its <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/days-of-our-lives?cid=2209orgdoolpknbenownedi5634%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dedi_awa_artbl&amp;utm_term=nbcviewers&amp;utm_content=daysofourlives" target="_blank"> “Days of Our Lives”</a> show) moving shows to exist solely on their websites instead of their weekly time-slot.</p>
			<p>Each year the networks who broadcast the Super Bowl publish its data analytics. To follow the reasoning behind why streaming is becoming popular, this article focuses on where viewership has become more concentrated, approval ratings of each network’s Spanish broadcast of the game, and overall viewership increase from the start.</p>

			<h3>Streaming is the future of broadcasting</h3>
			<p>Not only is the anticipation of the big game a factor in the rise of viewership, but it’s also the newfound accessibility of streaming. Magnite Research is a global company specializing in network programming and advertising platforms.Magnite Research has found <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.magnite.com/press-ja/magnite-research-finds-streaming-tv-is-most-watched-form-of-tv-in-the-nordics/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1682432101204901&usg=AOvVaw2ZhEaJ4vtRGdBPBw6nXHCT" target="_blank">"78% of TV viewers in the Nordics" are utilizing streaming over cable.</a> As seen by trends where more viewers streamed the Super Bowl starting in 2012, America is set to follow the Nordics in suit.</p>

			<p>Even though cable television has remained consistently popular for the Super Bowl, streaming numbers have exponentially risen as compared to cable television viewers. Cable television viewership peaked in 2015, before declining to become stagnant in recent years. Seen through the viewership and approval rating numbers from FOX, NBC, CBS, and ABC, there has been a -10.93% decrease in viewership of the Super Bowl on cable television from 2012 (when the networks first introduced streaming) to 2022. This demonstrates the beginning of viewers favoring streaming. There is a 3136.99% increase in viewers who streamed the Super Bowl from when it was first introduced (in 2012) until 2022. This further proves streaming to have the potential to take precedence over cable television broadcasts as consumer interests and accessibility changes.</p>	
			<p>I had the opportunity to speak with Gary Schreier, the senior vice president of the Fox Business Network, on if big networks (like FOX) are worried about their cable television following. He told me, "people will always watch it (cable). Yes the numbers will drop, but it will always have a following. As for the streaming aspect, everyone has a phone these days. We've been growing our presence on Fox Nation because of that. They're (streaming platforms) necessary to stay relevant in this digital age."

			<h3>This change doesn't just reflect English speakers</h3>
			<p>FOX has the highest approval rating for their Spanish broadcast of the Super Bowl from 2014-2022 with a 4.22% lead over NBC; meaning 4.22% more American households out of the total household population with access to cable television and streaming platforms (around 120.6 million households) favored FOX's broadcast. Spanish speakers have directly contributed to the rise of streaming in how automatically generated translations are available on each network's streaming platforms.</p>

			<h3>Cable television won't die out</h3>
			<p>Even with the rise of streaming services and more networks investing in their platforms, cable television is not in immediate danger. A Pew Research poll found in 2021 <a href= "https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/17/cable-and-satellite-tv-use-has-dropped-dramatically-in-the-u-s-since-2015/">56% of American adults still stick to their cable subscriptions.</a> While this number is down from 2015, cable television has maintained its viewership over the years. The legacy and infrastructure of cable television will keep it afloat for decades to come. Event viewing (such as the Grammys and Oscars), typical sports games, and local news all are formatted specifically for cable television in their respective live formats. Similarly to subscriptions on streaming websites, consumers can hand-pick their package of channels for cable television - making it a more streamlined medium.</p>

			<h3>Limitations of the observed data</h3>
			<p>A limitation in this dataset with its account of people is it does not account for the total number of viewers who may be standing around a TV or device, it just accounts for each TV or device that has the Super Bowl on. The Super Bowl is typically watched in groups across the nation, which limits the count in this dataset to account for only households.</p>
			<p>The dataset also does not include the total amount of viewership for the typical Super Bowl broadcast overall, across all languages. It also separates cable television from streaming, but does not do the same for the Spanish broadcasts. The Super Bowl broadcasts done in Spanish are placed into one category, making it impossible to know the numbers in which people chose to stream the Spanish broadcast over its cable counterpart.</p>
